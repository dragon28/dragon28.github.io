Please take note this vaccine was developed by [Rapid Deployment Vaccine Collaborative(RaDVaC)](https://radvac.org/) and it was for **research and development(R&D) purpose**.  


## Preferred equipment and materials

Certain equipment is required for efficient vaccine production and administration. Vaccine can be produced without specialized laboratory equipment but the process is more laborious and the results are likely to be more variable.


    * Pipettes: 1000 microliter, 200 microliter
    * Sterile filtered pipette tips: 1000 microliter, 200 microliter
    * Scale: gram scale accurate to 0.1 grams, or jeweler’s scale for very small amounts
    * Clean spatula for dry reagents
    * Small beakers for mixing and stirring. 10 ml to 25 ml beaker for stirring
    * Small bottles for stock solutions; 100 ml to 250 ml
    * 15 ml conical tubes
    * 50 ml conical tubes
    * 1.5 to 2 ml microcentrifuge tubes
    * Stirring apparatus: magnetic stir plate and small stir bar to fit in beaker
    * OPTIONAL but recommended: pH strips; range at least 2.0 to 9.0, but ideally from 0 to 10.0
    * Nasal spray apparatus. These are available through multiple vendors. We selected small nasal spray bottles (about 5 milliliter) with a pump-top apparatus. A tube stem about 4 cm long and approximately 1 mm inner diameter extends from the bottom of the apparatus, which can be placed into the bottom of a 2-ml tube containing vaccine. Our spray apparatus delivers about 100 microliters per pump.



## Acquiring vaccine ingredients

All materials and ingredients are commercially available. Again, the vaccine is very simple and consists of the following ingredients: peptide(s), chitosan, sodium triphosphate, sodium chloride, and water.


    * Epitope/antigen peptides. Multiple vendor options are available for synthetic peptides. These peptides are small synthetically produced portions of viral sequences.
    * Water-soluble chitosan derivatives such as trimethyl chitosan and HACC.
    * Sodium triphosphate, Na5P3O10. Multiple suppliers.
    * Sodium chloride (NaCl). 5M stock solution.
    * dH2O, deionized water (widely available).
    * OPTIONAL: White vinegar and/or sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3, baking soda) to adjust pH.
